Bank Statement Tagger - Standalone Version
==========================================

How to use:
1. Double-click "BankStatementTagger.exe" to launch the application.
2. Click "Select PDF Files" and choose your bank statements.
3. Click "Start Tagging".
4. The tagged files will be created in the same folder as the originals, with "_TAGGED" in the name.

Requirements:
- This app works best with original PDF files downloaded directly from the bank website.
- Windows 10 or 11.

Troubleshooting:
- If the app doesn't open, try running it as Administrator.
- If you see "OCR Failed" or need to process scanned images (not original PDFs), you may need to install additional software (Tesseract OCR and Poppler), but for most modern bank statements, this is NOT needed.

Enjoy!
